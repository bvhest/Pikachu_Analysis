# Description

**[User Story 84417](https://dev.azure.com/PhilipsAgile/1.0%20DC%20Digital/_workitems/edit/84417) - Analysis / break down of all CCR interfaces**

# Acceptance criteria

Document is created describing outgoing and incoming CCR interfaces.



# Summary

The CCR application(landscape) has a large number of outbound and inbound interfaces.

The interfaces described in this report were identified based on (old) documentation, by analysing known related applications (eg. PFS, Pikachu, AEM), connectivity software (SIM-tool) and based on interviews.

My feeling is that the most important information/data streams are known and in scope of the program. For these, alternative sources/sinks can be defined in the new application landscape based on ADAM and STEP. Because of the technology used in the CCR application(landscape), the new interfaces will often require modifications in the connected applications. This will require early contact with the supporting (external) parties.


My worries concern the lesser known or even undocumented interfaces. As CCR has grown over the years, there seem to be many hidden 'features' and 'feeds'. Some of these may become visible only after shutdown of CCR.


# Analysis CCR

CCR = Central Content Repository


## Functionality

Central storage for product-related content

  - consumer related (P4C, SDL leaflet rendering)
  - service related  
    * call-center (salesforce)
    * service-center (AYS)
  - resellers (wallmart, etc.)
  - reporting 
  - others (eg SAP packaging info)

Repository for 

  - assets (images, movies, leaflets, documents, ...)  
  Check [doc-types](http://pww.ccr.philips.com/cgi-bin/newmpr/conf_viewer.pl?confFile=doctypes.conf&sort=2)
  - product care text data (P4C/P4S-feeds)
  - FAQ's (OLEE: call-center related (currently obolete) and service-center related)
  - ...

## End-user applications

Central product-info hub:

  - [Find Your Product](http://pww.ccr.philips.com/ccrprd/f?p=402:100:1360897010053076)
  - [Product Care website (P4C)](https://www.p4c.philips.com/)
  - [Product Service website (P4S)](?)

Asset maintenance:

  - [asset upload widget](http://pww.ccr.philips.com/cgi-bin/newmpr/dcrt.pl), code1-authentication, role-based
  - [mass upload option](http://pww.ccr.philips.com/ccr_batch_upload-new.html)
  - asset search 
  - asset maintaintenance
  - reports(?)

FAQ maintenance:

  - OLEE

### CCR interfaces break-down by purpose

The above interfaces are many and diverse. To make the assignment manageable, the interfaces will be grouped by purpose. For each group, the status, content and interface details will be described.

The group of interfaces that are most relevant to the "PIL BCD Digital 2.0 Content"-project seem to be:

  1. Product marketing content (product assets, including commercial leaflets, and product catalog)
  2. Product service content
    * call-center (product identification and (restricted) assets)
    * service-center (product content and (restricted) assets)
  3. Product content for resellers (product content and (public) assets)
  4. generic interfaces (eg asset-downloads, reporting, etc.)


#### Product marketing content (website/leaflet rendering)

CCR feeds to Pikachu and SDL Rendering:

 a. Pikachu: product marketing and care catalog.
 b. Pikachu: (object)asset-list (asset metadata, including publ./internal/safe url), batch-based.
 c. SDL Rendering: asset (asset metadata, including url), batch-based.
 d. SDL Rendering: assets (physical asset files), GET-scripts.

CCR feeds from Pikachu and SDL Rendering:

 e. SDL Rendering: Leaflets (and corresponding metadata and images).

##### Product assets

![CCR asset exports](./images/CCR_asset_exports.png)

###### a. Asset-List export

Product-related assets, like Standard Product Photo,commercial leaflet, etc.

|         |                                                                        | 
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| purpose | a. publish product assets (physical files) to Adobe Scene7 (integrated, rich media management, publishing, and serving environment). | 
|         | b. publish product assets (logical files/url's) as part of the product-feed to the Philips marketing website. |
| asset-types | see document ["100_SyndicationChannels_consolidated.xlsx"](100_SyndicationChannels_consolidated.xlsx), tab "Assets". |
| type    | batch |
| frequency | daily |
| remarks | a. Assets are exported from CCR through SPOT to Pikachu. SPOT implements delta-filtering. Pikachu retrieves the Asset physical files and publishes these to Scene7. Pikachu includes the Asset logical files/url's into the feeds to the AEM website. |
|         | b. The assets are localised. |
|         | c. The AssetList only contains the MD5-checksum (and the doc-type) to identify the asset. |



###### b. Object-Asset-List export

Object-related assets, like feature images, awards, etc.

|         |                                                                        | 
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| purpose | a. publish category/feature assets (physical files) to Adobe Scene7 (integrated, rich media management, publishing, and serving environment). | 
|         | b. publish category/feature assets (logical files/url's) as part of the product-feed to the Philips marketing website. |
| asset-types | see document ["100_SyndicationChannels_consolidated.xlsx"](100_SyndicationChannels_consolidated.xlsx), tab "Assets". |
| type    | batch |
| frequency | daily |
| remarks | a. Assets are exported from CCR through SPOT to Pikachu. SPOT implements delta-filtering. Pikachu retrieves the Asset physical files and publishes these to Scene7. Pikachu includes the Asset logical files/url's into the feeds to the AEM website. |
|         | b. The assets are localised. |
|         | c. The ObjectAssetList only contains the MD5-checksum (and the doc-type) to identify the asset. |

*TODO*: check if asset-list is delivered directly from CCR or through SPOT. Why? Because CCR delivers an asset list to both Pikachu and SPOT.


###### c. Assets-2-SDL export

|         |                                                                        | 
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| purpose | publish product assets (logical files/url's for both assets and object-assets) to enable SDL-Rendering include images on the leaflets. |
| asset-types | *unknown* |
| type    | batch |
| frequency | daily |
| remarks | SDL retrieves the actual assets from CCR based on its own delta-filtering mechanism and by using the CCR GET-scripts (see id = 99). |
|   | The product-data required for the leaflets is send from Pikachu (RenderingExport (full & delta)) by using the SIM-tool (pikachu-to-rendering process). |



###### d. SDL-leaflets-2-CCR import

|         |                                                                        | 
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| purpose | Import the commercial leaflets generated by SDL. |
| asset-types | commercial leaflets (PSS) |
| type    | batch |
| frequency | daily |
| remarks | The import must include leaflet metadata (product-id, locale, creation date). The data is retrieved using the SIM-tool (rendering-to-ccr process). |

???


##### f. Find Your Product (FYP)

This FYP interface is not a physical interface between two applications as the FYP application is part of the CCR application landscape and is build on the CCR database.
Therefore this interface can be considered to be a 'logical' interface.




#### Generic feeds

##### Asset export

###### a. images/documents export

The CCR-2-Pikachu feed is described in the paragraphs "Asset(List)"-exports.

In addition, assets can be fetched from CCR by using the restricted url (using the (s)GET-scripts).

The following external applications use this funcionality:

  - SDL
  - FlixMediaProducts
  - ICEcat
  - WebcollageProducts
  - Amazon (through FlixMedia)
  - Wallmart (through FlixMedia)

The assets are made available to FlixMediaProducts, ICEcat and WebcollageProducts by sending the restricted url in the Pikachu feeds from 45 days before the start of publication.



###### b. videos export

|         |                                                                        | 
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| purpose | publish (product)video's to Scene7. | 
| type    | batch |
| frequency | daily |
| remarks | Delivered by the SIM-tool (ccr-to-scene7-videos process). |



##### Local Catalog Builder (LCB)

###### a. LCB inbound interface

This LCB interface is not a physical interface between two applications as the LCB application is part of the CCR application landscape and is build on the CCR database.
Therefore this interface can be considered to be a 'logical' interface.


###### b. LCB outbound interface

This LCB interface is not a physical interface between two applications as the LCB application is part of the CCR application landscape and is build on the CCR database.
Therefore this interface can be considered to be a 'logical' interface.

##### Reports

Data required for reporting was originally delivered to COGNOS. Cognos has been decomissioned and so are most of the reporting feeds.

Note: 

  - some reporting exports are still active and used by Peter for delivering CCR related statistics. A monthly report is delivered to Operations (Jorgen Gerstel: used for paying for infra structure and network traffic). 


##### SAP

Both an inbound and outbound interface exists with SAP.

The purpose of the outbound interface is to deliver pakacking-related information from CCR to SAP.

<<<<<<< HEAD
###### SAP-2-CCR interface 

???


=======
>>>>>>> ca27ec18ce4f2fd2bcbd6f07ba8e370eb3565e34
###### CCR-2-SAP interface 

Interface based on (Oracle) message queue in CCR-database. SAP puts the msgs on this queue. CCR processes the requests and deliveres the data. (eg product packaging info, REL-doctype). 

Note:

  - Same mechanism is used for the upload wizard.




# TODO

1. check info/asset requirements DS (digital services)/ EIM (enterprise information management).  
   how do they use CCR?
