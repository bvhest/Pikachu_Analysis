# STEP Digital Content - Impact on different service users

# Meeting

Rajiv Swami - Service Manager Global Claims & Analytics PH Consumer Care Europe & APAC  
date: 2019-01-30


## Meeting minutes 

The service centers, both the global and local centers, handle claims and service requests that come from both retailers and consumers.
The applications that are used by the service centers are shown in the following overview:

![Service Center application landscape](../images/serviceCenter_landscape.png)

#### At Your Service (AYS)

At Your Service (AYS) is the most important application in use.

The AYS application shows the product id (CTN code), a product image and product description.
Amongst other functionality, it can be used to find product service manuals. These service manuals are retrieved from CCR based in links. *Note* that the service manuals are not duplicated and stored locally in the AYS application.
The availability of the product service manuals is based on roles in the application. Product service manuals are only available to workshops (= the repair centers).

Call center information (another role) provides eg a kind of FAQ: questions & answers.

OnlinetTool: Service Network Support


##### overview of data and source of the data



##### IT contact

IT repsonsible: Ton Huybers (tech lead)





#### Salesforce

Salesforce is the customer relation management (CRM) application. Salesforce is the replacement of the old Siebel application.
In Salesforce, the product publication dates (sop/eop from CCR/LCB) are available, based on an interface to CCR/LCB. 

    *Note*: its not yet known if this interface is equal to the documented interface between CCR/LCB and Siebel.

If this info is not available in Salesforce,a case (when a consumer complaints) for a product can not be created in Salesforce.
Sometimes publication dates are not available, although the products are being sold. Than a case can not be created and an IT-ticket is required to get the product entered/updated in CCR/LCB and interfaced to Salesforce. It takes 2-3 days to get the sop/eop in Salesforece after an update in LCB.

*Note*: The call Centers in China  do not use Salesforce, but they can accesss thee same data. But thow?
China uses CCFS. GThis application gets its product data through a datahub called RCDH. **TODO** Check documentation on RCDH.
The Call Centers in China do not use AYS too!





They use both applications and product data that are provided by the CCR (landscape).

applications:

 - Find Your Product (FYP)

data:

 - product id (CTN)
 - product publication dates (sop/eop from LCB)
 - product sales info (products sold in a specific region)
 - product manuals
 









? who maintains the info required for claimes, like service manuals, etc?


## FYP

Most importantly used to check the publication status of products for different locales.
Used by global support (Ehvn & Amsterdam) and by Local (country) support.
Also used by 'customs' .

in addition:

- Sales information (amount of products sold in a country) is also queried.
- Assets for a product are queried by . Mostly quality- and environemental related.
- Predecessor/successor information
- FAQ's


## DMS (document management system)

DMS is based on Sharepoint, stores eg proof that a consumer bought a product (receipts).
DMS not connected to CCR (as far as R knows).


















-	Share the approach for IPL
-	Address what information will remain for servicers in P4S (are only secure assets sufficient or is the full set of product assets needed?)
-	How de we assure XC has all the products and is able to process updates

Some points I noted down from the meeting and a discussion with Peter afterwards. I’ve also added a few people to the cc to keep them informed.

We consider for now IPL only

  *	On P4C
    * Any IPL content will need to move to AEM
    * Servicers will as a result need to use both AEM for public data as well as P4S for the secured assets
    * Udo Jungbluth and Rajiv Swami can elaborate on feasibility  **Bart van Hest**
  *	On FYP
   *Not discussed how to transition, contact Joost Hungerink ** Bart van Hest**
  *	On XC
    * Timely insight in to required support of XC team needed to support the content release (E2E testing, PQ’s)  Pierre van Wanrooy
    * Status of the manual upload service needed to deal with new/changed content of S&RC products while the automated feed is being developed.  Harry / Nico 
    * XC users need PAL Code1 ID to be set up as part of cut over   Rohit
    * Demo needed on current usage  and future usability (attentionpoints is the URL handling for secured assets, session usage / authentication)  Nico 
  *	P4S
    * PAL Assets need to be made accessible via P4S (2 possible directions)  Rohit / Harry to select 1
    * What is the process / workinstruction need for new secured assets ??   **Bart van Hest** / Sabine?



## questions:

1. process of handling service requests ?

2. authentication ?
   LDAP user, user-type is ‘servicer’ ?

3. aplications in use ?  
   (specifically CCR based or connected to CCR)
   
4. asset requied for service ?
   (specifically CCR based or connected to CCR)

 
## answers:

add 4) 

*note:* source = P4C_Requirements-working_draft.doc

We have documents for the following Application Area’s (AA) in the CCR that are published to P4C:
*	AA2	- product related, 3-letter language code 
	   e.g. manual or Leaflet (public)
	   or Service Manual (restricted)
*	AA5	- product related, 2-letter country code
	   e.g. Warranty Booklet (public)
	   (we currently have no restricted document type for this AA)
*	AA10	- product related (no further meta data)
	   e.g Product Images
*	AA11	- product related, OLEE, restricted
	   e.g. Symptom Cures
*	AA12	- product related, OLEE, public
	   e.g. FAQ’s
*	AA13	- product related, OLEE, Flash or Flash-Video, public
	   e.g. Tutorials

2.4.2	Restricted content

?

5.2	Links to P4C

From a variety of sources links exist into the Product Support Pages or to documentation. 

5.2.1	Siebel

Link from Siebel are:

1.	Direct links to the Manual (DFU)
2.	Direct links to the Leaflet (PSS)
3.	Link to the Product Support page with the FAQ’s
4.	Link to the Product Support Page with the Call Center Scripts
5.	Link to the Product Support Page

5.2.1.1	Siebel data  

Siebel will add a variable (containing several data element; e.g. the Service request number) to the URL to P4C. These variables need to flow through the pages to be delivered to the FAQ. When an agent sends feedback in the feedback box in the FAQ the values are placed in the feedback data. This data is gathered by the process that generates the data for Cognos reporting. Cognos uses this data to create the FAQ/Feedback reporting (free-text reporting)

The URL’s to the FAQ-list’s and the Productt Support Site that are made available to the call centers by the CCR all end with the string ‘&pars=’. Siebel will add the data elements to this string is a predefined format. Each name/value pair is divided by a colon and prefixed with the string ‘,VARSET=’.

Example:  
,VARSET=SR_NUM:50-304135922,VARSET=AGENT_LOGIN:EUSEURT,VARSET=AGENT_ID:1E-1V08AV,VARSET=ACTIVITY_ID:1E-512OS4

Since the value is parameter ‘pars’ will hold the equal sign (‘=’) care has to be taken when processing this parameter to pass it on.

5.2.2	Call Centers China, and India

The Call Centers in China and India do not use Siebel, but have the same links as Siebel has. It is not know if they add the Call Center data described in 5.2.1.1.


Rajiv

global claims (from retailers) to AYS (at yuor service)



Rajiv's department does not maintain the documentation, FAQ's, etc. 

Who does maintain this?
Ask Udo for the technical info. DS for the product data.
THe service manual lis updated, not different s.manuals for different years (for products containing different parts.)
Udo Jungbluth = technical support person, responsible for the documentation maintenance and publication.


## authentication

based on LDAP.

How is a new person enroled.
