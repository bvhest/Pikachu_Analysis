## Meeting minutes 

The service centers, both the global and local centers, handle claims and service requests that come from both retailers and consumers.
The applications that are used by the service centers are shown in the following overview:

![Service Center application landscape](../images/serviceCenter_landscape.png)


### At Your Service (AYS)

At Your Service (AYS) is the most important application in use.

The AYS application shows the product id (CTN code), a product image and product description.
Amongst other functionality, it can be used to find product service manuals. These service manuals are retrieved from CCR based in links. *Note* that the service manuals are not duplicated and stored locally in the AYS application.
The availability of the product service manuals is based on roles in the application. Product service manuals are only available to workshops (= the repair centers).

Call center information (another role) provides eg a kind of FAQ: questions & answers.

#### overview of data and source of the data

| source      | information | interface | refresh frequency |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| CCR         | Product CTN       | link to P4C/P4S        | n.a.              |
| CCR         | Product image     | link to P4C/P4S        | n.a.              |
| CCR         | Product description     | link to P4C/P4S        | n.a.              |
| CCR         | Product service manuals | link to P4C/P4S        | n.a.              |

In short, the required product information is retrieved through a direct link to the P4C/P4S-product page.

### Salesforce

Salesforce is the customer relation management (CRM) application. Salesforce is the replacement of the old Siebel application.
In Salesforce, the product publication dates (sop/eop from CCR/LCB) are available, based on an interface to CCR/LCB. 

    *Note*: its not yet known if this interface is equal to the documented interface between CCR/LCB and Siebel.

If the product publication info is not available in Salesforce, a case (when a consumer complaints) for a product can not be created in Salesforce.

*Note*: it sometimes occurs that publication dates are not available, although the products are being sold. Than a case can not be created and an IT-ticket is required to get the product entered/updated in CCR/LCB and interfaced to Salesforce. It takes 2-3 days to get the sop/eop in Salesforece after an update in LCB.

*Note*: The call Centers in China  do not use Salesforce, but they can accesss thee same data. But thow?
China uses CCFS. GThis application gets its product data through a datahub called RCDH. **TODO** check documentation on RCDH.
The Call Centers in China do not use AYS either!


#### overview of data and source of the data

| source      | information | interface | refresh frequency |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| CCR         | Product CTN                              | ?         | ?              |
| CCR/LCB     | Product sop/eop                          | ?         | ?              |
| CCR         | (Siebel) Product manual (DFU)                     | direct link P4C/P4S | ?              |
| CCR         | (Siebel) Product Leaflet (PSS)                    | direct link P4C/P4S | ?              |
| CCR         | (Siebel) Product support page                     | direct link P4C/P4S | ?              |
| CCR         | (Siebel) Product support page (FAQs)              | direct link P4C/P4S | ?              |
| CCR         | (Siebel) Product support page (scripts)           | direct link P4C/P4S | ?              |


*Note*; 
* the lines with (Siebel) describe data that was used by Siebel. **TODO**: Is it also used by Salesforce?  
  --> YES (2019-02-05). The Product ID and sop/eop are provided by a feed from Pikachu (**???** no feeds with Salesforce, Siebel or 'service' in the name!). The Siebel format was more or less used 1-on-1 for the interface with Salesforce.
  Because Pikachu can't deliver all data, this feed is merged with a feed from CCR. This is implemented in Informatica.
* In short, most of the required product information is retrieved through a direct link to the P4C/P4S-product page.

### Find Your Product (FYP)

Find Your Product (FYP) is most often used to check the publication status of products for different countries. In addition, product assets are retrieved with FYP.

Additional information:

- Sales information (amount of products sold in a country),
- Product assets, mostly service guides, also quality- and environemental related.  
  Used by customer support and repair centers, 
- Predecessor/successor information
- FAQ's

This application is used by global support (Ehvn & Amsterdam) and by Local (country) support.
*Note*: it is also used by 'logistics'. **TODO**: check the details

|             |             |           |                   |

*Note*:

  1. the FAQ's are generated by Cognos (*stil in use?*) based on Free-Text-Reporting. As these FAQ's are present in CCR, there must be an interface from Cognos reporting to CCR. **TODO**: check the details
  2. "test"-product: QT4001/15


#### Technology

FYP is one of the applications that is part of the CCR landscape. It's developed with Oracle APEX as UI and the data is stored in an Oracle database.

### Document Management System (DMS)

DMS is, for example, used to store proof that a consumer bought a product (receipts).
DMS is not connected to CCR (as far as Rajiv knows).

*Note*:  
Product/service related documents in DMS can be uploaded (by consumers) through the Consumer Portal. These are also available in AYS. *These documents are out of our 'view'*!


#### overview of data and source of the data

- none


#### Technology

DMS is based on Microsoft Sharepoint.

## Open questions


 1. who maintains the info required for claimes, like service manuals, etc?

Rajiv's department does not maintain the documentation, FAQ's, etc. 

Who does maintain this?

--> Ask Udo for the technical info. DS for the product data.

THe service manual is updated, there are no different manuals for different years (for products containing different parts.)
Udo Jungbluth = technical support person, responsible for the documentation maintenance and publication.

  2. Maintenance of FAQ?  
  Partially based on Cognos reports on free text. Partially based on On Line Editing & Entry tool (OLEE), which is used for creation/maintenance fo FAQ-type of content.


  2. Application authentication is based on LDAP. How is a new person enroled?

  3. does it make sense to generate the current support pages as static html and start publishing new support pages for products from Stibo STEP from the go-live onward?  
  Motivation; the current support landscape is *large, complex and has scattered documentation*, making it *hard* to migrate the data, the interfaces, etc.
